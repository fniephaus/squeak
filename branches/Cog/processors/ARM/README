To build the GdbARMPlugin on linux (currently only supported on linux) get
gdb-7.6, e.g. from http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/gdb-7.6.tar.gz
Unpack it here so one obtains platforms/ARM/gdb-7.6

Then make sure you have binutils and libiberty installed.  e.g.

CentOS configuration for binutils and libiberty
yum install buinutils-devel
yum install compat-gcc-34

Ubuntu configuration for binutils and libiberty
sudo apt-get install binutils-dev libiberty-dev

Then

cd gdb-7.6/opcodes # i.e. processors/ARM/gdb-7.6/opcodes
./configure --target=arm-linux
make

cd ../sim/common # i.e. processors/ARM/gdb-7.6/sim/common
./configure --target=arm-linux
cd ../arm # i.e. processors/ARM/gdb-7.6/sim/arm
./configure --target=arm-linux
make

That should produce processors/ARM/gdb-7.6/sim/arm/libsim.a
With that built you can configure and build VMs that will build the ARM plugin.
