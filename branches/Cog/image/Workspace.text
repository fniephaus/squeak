This image is intended to build new CoInterpreter or StackInterpreter Cog VMs, and a Newspeak VM, and to run the Cog VM simulator (see the VM Simulation Workspace).The following doit offers a menu of configurations that create a single; source tree (../src) for all platforms.  Since they use a relative path they will work out of the box.  Generate the entire VM using them.  Choose Squeak Cog VM by default, and when prompted choose CoInterpreter.	VMMaker generateConfiguration	VMMaker generateAllConfigurationsUnderVersionControlTo rebuild this image run buildimage.shRead the class comments of StackInterpreterSimulator and CogVMSimulator for running the simulator.
