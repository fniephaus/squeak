How To Build On Mac OS X
------------------------
This file (build.macos32x86/HowToBuild) describes how to build VMs that run
32-bit images.  build.macos64x64/HowToBuild describes how to build VMs that
run 64-bit images.

Overview
--------
The "Cog" VM comes in a bewildering variety of forms.  The first distinction
is between Squeak/Croquet VMs that run Squeak, Pharo, Cuis, Croquet images
and their ilk, and between Newspeak VMs that run Newspeak.

Another distinction is between Stack, Cog and Sista VMs.  Stack VMs are those
with context-to-stack mapping that optimise message sending by keeping method
actications on a stack instead of in contexts.  These are pure interpreters but
significantly faster than the standard context-based Interpreter VM.  Cog VMs
add a JIT to the mix, compiling methods used more than once to maxchine code on
the fly.  Sista VMs, as yet unrealised and in development, add support for
adaptive optimization that does speculative inlining at the bytecode-to-bytecode
level.  These are targeted for release in 2015.

Another distinction is between "v3" VMs and Spur VMs.  "v3" is the original
object representation for Squeak as described in the back-to-the-future paper.
Spur, as described on the www.mirandabanda.org blog, is a faster object
representation which uses generation scavenging, lazy forwarding for fast
become, and a single object header format common to 32 and 64 bit versions.
Newspeak, Squeak 5 and the upcoming release of Pharo all use Spur.

Another distinction is between normal single-threaded VMs that schedule "green"
Smalltalk processes above a single-threaded VM, and "multi-threaded" VMs that
share the VM between any number of native threads such that only one native
thread owns the VM at any one time, switching between threads on FFI calls and
callbacks or on Smalltalk process switches when Smalltalk processes are owned
by threads.  This multi-threaded support is as yet experimental.

The final distinction is between production, assert and debug VMs.  Production
VMs are fully optimized, although they may include debugging symbols, and as
their name implies are for use in production.  Assert and debug VMs include
many assert checks that are disabled in the production VMs.  These asserts are
very helpful in debugging VM problems but significantly impact performance.
The difference between assert and debug VMs is that assert VMs are compiled
with moderate optimization, which improves the performance of the asserts,
whereas debug VMs are compiled with no optimization at all, providing maximum
debuggability with minimum performance.

This directory tree provides build directories for some of this matrix.  For
example, squeak.cog.v3 contains a build directory for Smalltalk Cog VMs using
the old object representation, newspeak.stack.spur contains a build directory
for Newspeak Stack VMs using the Spur object representation.  Build as desired.


Checking out sources to build out-of-the-box
--------------------------------------------
Check-out at least the relevant platform sources, vm and plugin sources,
processor sources and the relevant build directories
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/platforms
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/processors
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/{spursrc,src} etc
		(see section "VM source directories" in the root README)
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/sources
		(this is needed only to install Smalltalk source files)
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/build.macos32x86


Building out of the box
-----------------------
0. The build system is based on Gnu Make for makefiles, and Xcode.app for
compilers and libraries.  You will need a Mac OS X machine running at least
10.7.x (the author is currently using 10.9) and Xcode v6 or later.  The system
builds only the new Cocoa based VMs that use the platforms/iOS tree.  The old
Carbon-based VMs using platforms/Mac OS are unsupported.

1. Install the tools (Xcode etc).  If you want to sign the application make sure
you have installed a suitable certificate via Keychain Access and that the
signing identity is in the SIGNING_IDENTITY environment variable, e.g. in the
author's .profile is the line
export SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Eliot Miranda"

2. cd to the VM configuration of your choice and run the mvm script, e.g.
	cd buiild.macos32x86/squeak.cog.spur
	./mvm -A
This will build CocoaFast.app, CocoaDebug.app and CocoaAssert.app applications
containing the three basic VM configurations.  If the configuration includes
the multi-threaded
VM you can use mvm -AS to make the single-threaded VMs, mvm -AT to make the
multi-threadeds in FastMT.app et al, and mvm -A to make them all.  mvm -d will
make the Debug.app VM, etc.  mvm -? provides the gory details.

Each build directory contains three files
	plugins.int
	plugins.ext
Editing these and making is all one needs to do to change the set of plugins.
But see The Structure of the Makefiles below for "complicated" plugins.


The Structure of the Makefiles
------------------------------
Each VM build directory contains the mvm script, a root Makefile that selects
the VM source to build, plugins.int to specify the internal plugins to build,
and plugins.ext to specify the external plugins (if any) to build.  The root
Makefile then includes a full Makefile from the common directory.  For example,
squeak.cog.spur's Makefile (minus commentary) reads
	----8<-----build.macos32x86/squeak.cog.spur/Makefile----8<---------------
	VMSRCDIR:= ../../spursrc/vm
	SOURCEFILE:=SqueakV50.sources

	include ../common/Makefile.app.squeak.cog
	----8<-----build.macos32x86/squeak.cog.spur/Makefile----8<---------------
Some external plugins require spport libraries.  In particular, the processor
simulators used by VMMaker.oscog to develop the VM JITs, depend on C or C++
code that implements a processor simulator.  See below.  Plugins that require
extra support or special compilation have makefiles under
platforms/iOS/plugins/, for example plugins/iOS/plugins/RePlugin/Makefile.
This Makefile sets some values and then includes common/Makefile.plugin to do
the dirty work.  If you add an exotic plugin that requires such source please
read the plugin makefile build.macos32x86/common/Makefile.plugin and the
makefiles under plugins/iOS/plugins for examples of the facilities available.

The files in build.macos32x86/common are
	Makefile.app
		The top-level makefile for CocoaFast.app et al.
		It includes Makefile.vm to build the vm and plugins and then constructs
		and optionally signs the .app bundle.  It may also install a Smalltalk
		source file.
	Makefile.app.newspeak
		Modifies Makefile.app to rename the executable and install sources
	Makefile.app.squeak.cog
		Modifies Makefile.app to use the green VM icon that implies Cog
	Makefile.flags
		Defines the compilation flags and SDK to use in building the VM
	Makefile.plugin
		Makes either an internal FooPlugin.lib or an external FooPlugin.bundle.
		If platforms/iOS/plugins/FooPlugin/Makefile exists Makefile.vm will
		use it, and it should include Makefile.plugin to do the dirty work.
	Makefile.rules
		Defines the rules for compiling c, c++ and objective-c source files,
		including maintaining dependency information.
	Makefile.vm
		Makes the VM executable in the chosen configuration from product,
		assert or debug.  Decodes plugins.int and plugins.ext and invokes
		make with the relevant makefile, either a special one such as
		platforms/iOS/plugins/RePlugin/Makefile or Makefile.plugin, for each
		internal or external plugin.
	mkNamedPrims.sh
		This script makes sqNamedPrims.h which defines the exports from the set
		of internal plugins that the VM uses to access the primitives in
		internal plugins.


Building the VM Simulator Support Libraries
-------------------------------------------
As of this writing there are three processors with three sets of support
libraries.  If you want to build these they are in
	build.macos32x86/{bochsx86,bochsx64,gdbarm32}
In each directory there is a conf.COG script.  Cd to the directory, run the
script, and in the case of the bochs directories also run makeem.  e.g.
	$ cd build.macos32x86/bochsx86
	$ ./conf.COG
	$ ../../processors/IA32/bochs/makeem
Then cd to the VM build directoruy of your choice and build.


Using Different Compilers
-----------------------------------------
The build system uses Xcode's default compiler, clang by default.
You may want to use a different compiler.  Users claim this is possible.
For example, to install gcc 5.2 see
	http://hamelot.co.uk/programming/add-gcc-compiler-to-xcode-6/
(Thanks Hammad!).  There are no guarantees that this will work, but that's the
best pointer I've found.
