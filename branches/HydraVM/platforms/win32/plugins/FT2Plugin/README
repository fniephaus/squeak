To build a freetype plugin, place the freetype package in same dir, where your platforms subdir resides,
e.d.

  .somedir/
     platforms/
     winbuild/
     freetype-2.3.7/

or, change the FT2_DIR in makefile to point to appropriate directory, where freetype headers can be found.



Instructions to build a freetype.dll :

Here the instructions how to build a freetype.dll from freetype 2.3.7 package.

It was tested to run successfully under mingw/msys environment.

- copy modules.mk into {Free type lib location}/builds/
  and win32-def.mk into {Free type lib location}builds/win32/  over existing files.

- run make from the mingw bash shell in {Free type lib location}. 

As result you should get a freetype.a file in {Free type lib location}/objs directory

To create a .dll copy freetype.def from this directory (where README lies) to {Free type lib location}/objs directory.

Then do following (in mingw shell):
  cd {Free type lib location}/objs
  dllwrap -def freetype.def -o freetype.dll freetype.a
  strip freetype.dll


Notes about freetype.def : 
  The file, generated automatically by apinames.exe contains DESCRIPTION directive which my dllwrap tool
  simply don't want to understand. Remove it, no big deal!

  Also, an automatically built .def contains exports of some functions available only on Macs. 

  All these issues you can see if you run dlltool with autogenerated freetype.def.
  You can use the freetype.def, which i provided, or modify generated one to make a freetype.dll.
