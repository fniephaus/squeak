This directory contains scripts that can buld various VMMaker and Spur images.
As of early 2015 the default VMMaker build script is
	buildspurvmmakerimage.sh
and it builds a Spur VMMaker image.

The standard Cog VMMaker image is built loading the latest VMMaker.oscog and Cog
packages, plus support packages, into an updated Squeak trunk image.
You can build this image using buildsqueaktrunkvmmakerimage.sh.
Once you start-up the image various workspaces contain useful expressions to
run the simulator, test slang output and so on.  The "do..." menu off the main
screen menu also contains expressions to generate VM sources.
