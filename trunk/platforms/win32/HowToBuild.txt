0. Prerequisites

You will need a working installation of MinGW (for the compilation environment)
and MSYS (for the configuration and build environment).  See:

    http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started

You will also need the DX7 SDK.  This can be obtained from:

    http://squeakvm.org/win32

In the instructions that follow we assume that you are working in an MSYS
terminal window.


1. Obtain the Squeak VM sources

A recent, reliable set of sources can be obtained from http://squeakvm.org/win32
as a zip archive.  Unpack them and descend one level into the folder structure
that is created.

    unzip SqueakX.Y.Z-N.win32-src.zip
    cd SqueakX.Y.Z-N

If you prefer to live dangerously, the current developers' sources can be
checked out from the Squeak VM repository:

    svn co http://squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/trunk/platforms

In either case, you should now have a folder called 'platforms' in the current
working directory.


2. Create and configure a build environment

Create a folder in which to build the VM and 'cd' into it.  This can be
anywhere, but a folder next to 'platforms' is typical.  If you followed the
instructions above, you might simply type:

    mkdir build
    cd build

Configure the build environment by running the 'platforms/win32/build/configure'
script from within your build folder.

    ../platforms/win32/build/configure

This will attempt to locate the roots of your MinGW and DX7SDK trees.  If it
fails then you must run the script with one or more of the following options to
tell it where to look:

    .../configure MINGW=<path-to-your-MinGW-folder>
    .../configure DX7SDK=<path-to-your-dx7sdk-folder>

(Note that there is another option:

    .../configure SRC=<path-to-your-src-folder>

to specify the location of the generated 'src' tree to use.  If you run VMMaker
yourself then this option tells the build to use your 'src' tree instead of the
one bundled in the zip file and repository under platforms/win32/build/src.)


3. Compile the VM

Running:

    make

should leave a folder in your working directory called SqueakX.Y.Z-N that
contains the VM .exe file, the .dll files that it uses, and the default .ini
file.  (Note that parallel builds, using "make -j N", are not supported at this
time.)

The VM is 'portable' and can be run directly from the Squeak.X.Y.Z-N folder.


4. Install the VM

Just copy the above SqueakX.Y.Z-N folder from your build directory to
"C:\Program Files" or some other location.  Since it is 'portable' you can also
copy it to any media (USB flash drive, etc.) and run it directly, without
installation, from that media.
