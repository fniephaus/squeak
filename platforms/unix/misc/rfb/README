This code is support code for an - experimental - RFB server implementation
in Squeak. The idea is to use this for server-side Squeak.

Copied from the VNC Xserver source code. This is the basis for a Squeak
built-in RFB server. Plan of attack:
- Make sqXwindow bitmap (stImage) available to rfb server;
- Start RFB server;
- See whether we can connect and view a snapshot;
- Add updating;
- Add event processing;
- Iterate until perfect;
- Remove unneeded code (everything in sqXWindow.c that talks to X :-)).
This way, we can slowly move in while always being able to work/test
in Squeak. In fact, in version 2 I'd like to simply share the bitmap
image and update list with Smalltalk and code the RFB server over there...
